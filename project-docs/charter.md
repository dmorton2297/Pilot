**Project Title**: Pilot Project Management

**Team Members**: Darren Visak, Blake Thomas, Michael Judd, Dan Morton

**Project Background and Motivation:**
The overall problem we are trying to solve with this application is the facilitation of project management in software development teams. 

To improve overall workflow, SCRUM methodologies (namely, the scrum board) will be implemented through an online project management application. This will improve team accountability by organizing the tasking of the application into an easy interface, making roles and deadlines clear. 

**Project Objectives:**
* Team creation and user groups allowing for project teams with leveled permissions to allow for * collaboration. 
* Task creation and backlog management to allow for task organization.
* Task assignment to a team user to promote working accountability.
* Task progression through a virtual SCRUM board to promote efficiency in a team.
* Task estimation and burndown to provide insight to management.
* Role Based Authentication Control / Sign-in to protect our user base.
* Dashboard to offer at a glance information about a particular team’s/user’s task set.
